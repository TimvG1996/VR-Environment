# VR-Environment
A small project to get myself familiar with VR development in Unity wherein a user can move around in an open environment.
Added hand collision and being able to pick up objects such as different balls and boxes in different sizes with their own physics. 
Also added some audio such as background music and sound effects for the bouncing balls. 
Code is in the Assets/Scripts folder.
